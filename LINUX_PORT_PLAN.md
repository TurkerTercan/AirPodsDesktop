# AirPodsDesktop Linux Port Plan

## Status

As of 2026-11-13, the Linux port builds and runs, with the main desktop features implemented:

- [x] Linux CMake build, bundled runtime, DEB and tarball packaging.
- [x] BlueZ Bluetooth discovery, AirPods binding and battery/connection display.
- [x] MPRIS ear-detection playback control, BlueZ Quick Connect, XDG autostart, tray and settings.
- [x] System theme detection through the desktop portal, with a Qt fallback.
- [x] Linux tray noise control for supported models, using the bound classic Bluetooth device.
- [x] Linux automated suite: 14 of 14 CTest entries passed in the latest run, including noise-control,
      media, domain and UI tests. These tests do not replace hardware validation.

### Hardware observations and remaining work

- [x] On AirPods Pro 3, the user reported Noise Cancellation, Transparency, Adaptive and Off working.
      Device reports in the trace independently confirmed Noise Cancellation and Adaptive; the later
      Transparency and Off selections were not captured in that trace.
- [ ] Verify noise control and the rest of the port across additional AirPods models, firmware,
      Bluetooth adapters and desktop environments. Earlier Off and repeated Adaptive requests timed
      out; their causes were not established. Off may require enabling Off Listening Mode on an Apple
      device, but a timeout alone does not establish that this is the cause.
- [ ] Verify Wayland and measure low-latency/codec behavior on Linux.
- [ ] Decide on Linux release assets; the updater is disabled on Linux until suitable assets exist.
      Local RelWithDebInfo DEB and tarball builds succeeded and their extracted payloads matched;
      dependencies resolved on the build host. A Release build, clean-machine installation and
      packaged application startup have not yet been verified.

GNOME requires an AppIndicator extension for the tray. The taskbar battery dock is Windows-only.
See `Docs/Build.md` for build, packaging and noise-control limitations.

## Original plan (historical)

The phases, examples and estimates below record the original proposal, not the current
implementation or remaining work. The feature parity checklist is updated separately. In particular,
the Bluetooth packet and scanning examples are
illustrative and should not be used as protocol or implementation references; consult the source and
`Docs/Build.md` instead. Current status is tracked above.

## Executive Summary
AirPodsDesktop uses Qt with platform-specific subsystems for Bluetooth, media control, auto-start, and audio management. The codebase has well-structured abstract interfaces, making it suitable for a Linux port. Estimated effort: **2-3 months** for a complete port with full feature parity, or **3-4 weeks** for a minimal viable port (Bluetooth + battery display only).

## Phase 1: Build System (Week 1)

### 1.1 Update CMakeLists.txt
- **Remove**: Hard Windows-only checks (lines 51-62)
- **Add**: Platform detection and conditional compilation
- **Add**: Linux-specific find_package calls for BlueZ, D-Bus, GLib, ALSA/PipeWire

```cmake
# Platform detection
if(WIN32)
    set(APD_PLATFORM "windows")
elseif(UNIX AND NOT APPLE)
    set(APD_PLATFORM "linux")
endif()

# Conditional dependencies
if(APD_PLATFORM STREQUAL "linux")
    find_package(Bluez REQUIRED)
    find_package(DBus REQUIRED)
    find_package(Glib REQUIRED)
    find_package(ALSA REQUIRED)
endif()
```

### 1.2 Platform-Specific Source Files
```cmake
# Windows sources
if(APD_PLATFORM STREQUAL "windows")
    target_sources(apd_core PRIVATE
        Source/Core/Bluetooth_win.cpp
        Source/Core/AutoStart_win.cpp
        Source/Core/GlobalMedia_win.cpp
        Source/Core/QuickConnect_win.cpp
    )
endif()

# Linux sources (new files to create)
if(APD_PLATFORM STREQUAL "linux")
    target_sources(apd_core PRIVATE
        Source/Core/Bluetooth_linux.cpp
        Source/Core/AutoStart_linux.cpp
        Source/Core/GlobalMedia_linux.cpp
        Source/Core/QuickConnect_linux.cpp
    )
endif()
```

### 1.3 Linux Dependencies
```bash
# Ubuntu 24.04
sudo apt install \
    libbluetooth-dev \
    libdbus-1-dev \
    libglib2.0-dev \

    libpipewire-0.3-dev \
    libpulse-dev \
    libx11-dev \
    libwayland-dev
```

## Phase 2: Bluetooth Subsystem (Weeks 2-3)

### 2.1 Replace WinRT Bluetooth with BlueZ D-Bus API

**Current**: `Bluetooth_win.cpp` uses WinRT `Windows.Devices.Bluetooth.Advertisement` for BLE scanning.

**Linux Implementation**: Use BlueZ's D-Bus API via `gdbus` or `sd-bus`.

```cpp
// Example: Start BLE advertising scan via D-Bus
g_dbus_connection_emit_signal(conn, NULL, "/org/bluez/hci0",
    "org.bluez.LEAdvertisingManager1", "RegisterAdvertisingApplication",
    parameters, NULL);
```

### 2.2 Parse Apple AirPods BLE Advertisements
Apple uses manufacturer data with company ID 0x004C (76 decimal). The payload format is well-documented.

**Key Limitation:** BlueZ D-Bus API does NOT support filtering by manufacturer data at the D-Bus level. You must filter in application code by inspecting each device's `ManufacturerData` property.

**Advertisement Format (Paired Mode, 27 bytes total):**
```
Byte 0-2:  0x07 0x19 0x01 (protocol header)
Byte 3-4:  Device model (e.g., 0x0220 = AirPods 1)
Byte 5:    UTP flags
Byte 6:    Case battery level (bits 0-3) + charging flag (bit 6)
Byte 7:    Left bud battery (bits 0-3) + right bud battery (bits 4-7)
Byte 8:    Lid state
Byte 9-26: Encrypted status data
```

**Battery values use 10% steps (0-10), not exact percentages. Value 0xF = unavailable.**

```cpp
// C example: Parse AirPods battery from manufacturer data
#include <stdint.h>

typedef struct {
    int model;
    int case_battery;      // -1 = unavailable
    int left_battery;      // -1 = unavailable
    int right_battery;     // -1 = unavailable
    bool case_charging;
    bool lid_open;
} AirPodsBattery;

static int percent(int nibble) {
    if (nibble > 10) return -1;  // 0xF = unavailable
    return nibble * 10;
}

bool parse_airpods_battery(const uint8_t *data, int len, AirPodsBattery *out) {
    if (len < 27 || data[0] != 0x07 || data[1] != 0x19 || data[2] != 0x01) {
        return false;  // Not AirPods format
    }
    
    out->model = data[3] | (data[4] << 8);
    out->case_battery = percent(data[6] & 0x0F);
    out->left_battery = percent(data[7] & 0x0F);
    out->right_battery = percent((data[7] >> 4) & 0x0F);
    out->case_charging = (data[6] & 0x40) != 0;
    out->lid_open = (data[6] & 0x08) != 0;
    
    return true;
}
```

### 2.3 Implement Device Manager Interface
Implement `DeviceManagerAbstract` interface:
- Device discovery via BlueZ
- Device connection state monitoring
- Battery level reporting

---

## Phase 3: System Tray and GUI (Week 4)

### 3.1 System Tray Integration
Qt's `QSystemTrayIcon` works on Linux via DBus StatusNotifierItem.

```cpp
// Check if tray is available
if (QSystemTrayIcon::isSystemTrayAvailable()) {
    trayIcon->show();
} else {
    // Fallback: keep window visible
    showWindow();
}
```

### 3.2 GNOME Desktop Integration
For GNOME, use AppIndicator/KStatusNotifierItem extension:
- Check if `org.gnome.Shell.Extensions.AppIndicator` is installed
- Provide fallback behavior if not

### 3.3 Wayland Support
Qt handles Wayland natively. Ensure proper environment variables:
- `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`
- `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP`

---

## Phase 4: Media Control (Weeks 5-6)

### 4.1 MPRIS D-Bus Integration
Linux uses MPRIS (Media Player Remote Interfacing Specification) for media control.

```cpp
// Query active MPRIS players
QDBusInterface player("org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.playerctl",
    "/org/mpris/MediaPlayer2",
    "org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Player");

// Control playback
player.call("PlayPause");
```

### 4.2 Media Key Handling
- Use libmpd or libpulse for audio session detection
- Handle media key events via X11 or Wayland protocols

---

## Phase 5: Audio Latency Optimization (Week 7)

### 5.1 PipeWire/ALSA Integration
For low-latency audio, use ALSA or PipeWire directly:

```cpp
// ALSA low-latency setup
snd_pcm_t *handle;
snd_pcm_open(&handle, "default", SND_PCM_STREAM_PLAYBACK, 0);
snd_pcm_set_params(handle, ...);  // Configure for low latency
```

### 5.2 Bluetooth Codec Support
- Verify A2DP codec support on Linux
- Test with aptX, LDAC, SBC codecs
- Ensure low-latency codec selection works

---

## Phase 6: Auto-Start and System Integration (Week 8)

### 6.1 XDG Autostart
Write autostart `.desktop` file:

```cpp
// Create autostart entry
QDir dir(QStandardPaths::writableLocation(QStandardPaths::ConfigLocation));
dir.mkpath("autostart");
QFile file(dir.filePath("airpods-desktop.desktop"));
file.open(QIODevice::WriteOnly);
file.write("[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nExec=airpods-desktop\n");
```

### 6.2 Systemd User Service
Optional: Provide systemd user service for background operation.

---

## Phase 7: Testing and Validation (Week 9+)

### 7.1 Test Matrix
- **OS**: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (GNOME default)
- **Bluetooth**: Test with various Bluetooth adapters
- **Audio**: Test with PulseAudio, PipeWire, ALSA
- **Wayland/X11**: Test both display servers
